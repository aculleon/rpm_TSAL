1. We are using P-MOSFETs to control the TSAL on the Mainhoop (TSAL Schematic Page 2 and TSAL RED Schematic Page 1). We are using an industrial 1 segment signal lamp (DV2120). We cannot provide a detailed schematic of the LED.
3. We discarded the CANBus concept and are connecting the cockpit TS Off indicator to the same Cable as the TSAL LED.
5. This is correct. It is an additional safety check for the software stucking detection. 
9. We split the TSAL into 2 PCBs. The TSAL PCB remains inside the TSAC and the TSAL RED PCB is located inside the HVD enclosure(i.e. outside the TSAC)
